        Each sprint, one person from each team acts as a **QA Engineer** for the *other*
        team's product (Gauss.Chat ↔ Gauss.OS).

        Spend **one day** using it to solve a *real* task, explore workflows, and
        document your observations here.

        Please do it **at the beginning of the sprint** such that there is enough time
        for your bug reports and feature request to potentially make it to the very next
        sprint.
